# CVPrac
Programming Practical for ClickView

## Preface
Unfortunately, I was not able to complete much of the UI components to the task (as it is is not my strongest skill), and that is why the initial display only displays the root folders.

Instead, I decided to focus on building the logic and backend frameworks for the project (this being my strong suit). Therefore, the ending project is only viewable via the console. The following will highlight the instructions and rationales behind certain design choices.

## How to view the result

### Open index.html

### Open console (via developer tools) for browser
From here enter `root_folder` into the command line.

### This is the structure given to folder objects (now viewing the Root Folder)
By working with Folder objects, it was easier to handle the different variables stored, e.g. name of folder as a string, subfolders as an array of folders, and videos as an array of videos.

Upon startup, the the videos are all stored respective to their folder directory. Therefore, all that is required is to parse this information onto the webpage.

### Navigate the console root_folder to ensure correct structure of the videos and folders.
As mentioned before, the data just needs to be parsed for display.

## Future Implementations
### UI, of course
### Filter by tags
The tag filter task (Task 4) was implemented on the backend, but once again not implemented to display.
